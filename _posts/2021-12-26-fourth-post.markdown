# The Old Man and the Sea


### I read The Old Man and the Sea today

Almost exactly half way through the book it says this, which stood out to me: 

> But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.\
> 'I told the boy I was a strange old man,' he said. 'Now is when I must prove it.'\
> The thousand times he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it. 

I liked this book, and I like that I read it in a single sitting (two hours almost exactly for 99 small pages), which was staisfying. I think it's worth it for you to read it too, if you have two hours to spare.
