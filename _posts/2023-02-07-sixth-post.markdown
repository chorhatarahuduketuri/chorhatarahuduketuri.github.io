# Software vs Hardware vs Robotics

Something occurred to me just now (or in the last hour or so as I've been reading some random post of HN criticising 'Big Data' as not real or dead or data scientists as truth launderers for middle managers or some other facet of 'all work is useless' and Hail Mary (good book that makes you want to carry Pocket Ref 4th Edition around everywhere)): all the knowledge in the world doesn't change anything and is utterly powerless. Only if a decision is made differently - that's why all those dashboards are useless and all the data from your fitness tracker doesn't make you weigh any less and all the information about how your HVAC is configured and how moist your soil is and how your machines are vibrating becomes irritating and you ignore it after a year. _You_ have to actually _go and do something_ differently. And once you have or you've entrained a different pattern, you've encoded that knowledge into your behavioural patterns and you're done with it. You don't need to see it any more. Unless you _constantly_ need to change what you're doing _all the time_. And who tolerates that with IoT sensor data? No one. _They either ignore it, or automate the output...._

Knowledge _isn't_ power. _"Power is a phenomenon of physically making things happen"_ - Uchiha Madara in poorly subbed translation. And he is correct. Software has no power in areas it isn't making something _happen_ differently. 

It explains why I'm getting so bored of just discovering things. It's all nothing. Nothing doing nothing for no effect. 

For all my data to actually _do_ something.... well.... I guess it'd have to either tell me what to do at any given time, or frame my choices for me in if-one-then-this-else-if-the-other-do-that and pick-A-or-B-or-do-C-to-be-allowed-to-pick-D like shapes. Perhaps operating an incentives based system to allow me (self-defined) constricted freedom of choice around order of operations and/or scheduling. Or just to remind me not to leave certain things too long. The difference between FitBit and Garmin fitness trackers isn't just that Garmin's sleep tracking is garbage in comparison. It's also that Garmin _makes the decision of what kind of running to do __for__ me_. It does that cognition in my place, and I don't have to. And it adjust it (a bad week resulted in it giving me a week of 'easy run's so I could recover and not wear myself out while catching up on sleep etc.)  

Or it would have to take information-actions for me - make transactions, make purchases, communicate in my name (or at least put them in my outbox for human review), take and submit meter readings to my energy company for me, and then adjust my Direct Debit to match what I actually owe them and not 'build up credit' with them like they were my bank or something.  

Or it would have to be physical action, which is robotics. It's always robotics - washing machines and dish washers are robots in cuboid boxes. Something with a camera and a motor attached to the archaic thermostats in my current house and a temperature sensor and a connection to weather data that adjusts it to homeostatically control the temperature of my home is a robot. The very short cylinder on wheels that vacuums my floor every day (that I don't stop it) is a robot. An automated system that monitors plant growth and controls a hydroponic growing system to maximise floral output is a robot. A camera and a grabber and an ML model that identifies weeds and harvestable plants and pulls them out and puts them in separate buckets, replacing harvested plants with new seedlings is a robot. 

Robots actually change things. Robots actually _do_ things. I'm more and more interested in actually _doing_ things that I was before (whatever/whenever/wherever 'before' is.) I want to do things that result in more things happening. I want to write software that executes information-actions. I want to write software that tells me the best thing to do when I have to make a decision that the calculation for can be done by a computer. I want to make robots that physically make things happen. And I want to program them to physically make those things happen. 

I don't really know what to do with that, it's just something I thought, and the response I had in feelings and resultant desires.
