# Ok nm all that other stuff

I'm getting evicted from my (rented) home and made redundant within the space of about a week next month. And I'm going on holiday from this coming Sunday to the following Saturday (when I'm landing at about 15 minutes to midnight.) This is a suboptimal situation. So I'm writing it down. 

On the upside Garmin is telling my VO2 max is back up to 52, a +2 improvement since the start of the year (where it may or may have been 49.9ish but let's not go there.) My right serratus anterior still appears to be missing after my shoulder injury but I'm irregularly working on getting it back. 

So I need to find somewhere to rent in the space of about a week, move there, or put all my stuff into storage and find somewhere else to be until I find somewhere to live, and then _after_ that I need to get another job, after working at a failing company that is busy tidying itself up for being acquired in North America or something, so dumping all of it's UK/EU staff, which has been a demotivating experience. I should go find some source of motivation. Perhaps I should make something that I want to make. 

But first! Somewhere to live! And a haircut (but by me instead of the heretic who messed up my hair and my beard so badly I had to clean shave and recut it myself)! And a yoga retreat!

EDIT: oh and I bought the entire back catalogue of Demoscene Time Machine earlier today. I am glad I have this.

And this is the habit tracker I use - I wonder if it's possible to get a feature added to automatically export the SQLite .db file to Google Drive, because that would be very useful for my other project.
