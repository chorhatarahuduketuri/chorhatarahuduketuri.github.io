# 2023 Goals


### Try and try again. 

I'm going to try to write 52 blog posts this year. This counts as the first. Obviously, that implies that there would be 1 per week. The average would certinaly be about that. Obviously, that is now impossible, as it is already the second week, and this is only the first post of this year. 

I'm going to _try_ to publish at a rate of 1 per week, where 'week' is calendar week. 

What to write about? New Years Resolutions? Impossible, since I have only one resolution, _singular_. I _do_ have a lot of 2020 _goals_ - 23, in fact. (Well, 24, because I'm counting from -0 and they go all the way up to 23.) 

One of them is to complete several projects that have actual, physical outputs. I'll probably write about those. There's a bunch of other things I can write about as well, including any new places I visit or whisk(e)ys I drink. And anything of any particular interest that I cool (like the BigMac Wellington that I cooked with a friend yesterday.) I will probably also write about the systems I will inevitably end up creating to track and quantify my progression towards these goals. Or I won't, because ofc any and all of these things may not happen. 

REGARDLESS, it's a thing I'm going to try to do this year, and I look forward to being successful at it.
